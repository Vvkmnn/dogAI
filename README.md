Another [AIND](https://www.udacity.com/course/artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd889) project, in which we will learn how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world, user-supplied images.

## Goal
Primarly: **Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed**. 

This model uses **Convolutional Neural Networks**, **Haar Cascades**, and **Transfer Learning**, as implemented via [**Keras**](https://keras.io/) and [**TensorFlow**](https://www.tensorflow.org/). It was originally put together by the awesome dudes at [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/dog-project), I just completed certain bits. 


## Setup

#### macOS:
	```
		conda env create -f requirements/aind-dog-mac.yml
		source activate aind-dog
		KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow python -c "from keras import backend"
	```

#### Linux:
	```
		conda env create -f requirements/aind-dog-linux.yml
		source activate aind-dog
		KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow python -c "from keras import backend"
	```

#### Windows:
	```
		conda env create -f requirements/aind-dog-windows.yml
		activate aind-dog
		set KERAS_BACKEND=tensorflow
		python -c "from keras import backend"
	```

## Hosting

Instead of training your model on a local CPU (or GPU), you could use Amazon Web Services to launch an EC2 GPU instance.  Please refer to the [Udacity instructions](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd889/parts/16cf5df5-73f0-4afa-93a9-de5974257236/modules/53b2a19e-4e29-4ae7-aaf2-33d195dbdeba/lessons/2df3b94c-4f09-476a-8397-e8841b147f84/project) for setting up a GPU instance for this project.

## Future 

#### (1) Augment the Training Data 

[Augmenting the training and/or validation set](https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html) might help improve model performance. 

#### (2) Turn your Algorithm into a Web App

Turn your code into a web app using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) or [web.py](http://webpy.org/docs/0.3/tutorial)!  

#### (3) Overlay Dog Ears on Detected Human Heads

Overlay a Snapchat-like filter with dog ears on detected human heads.  You can determine where to place the ears through the use of the OpenCV face detector, which returns a bounding box for the face.  If you would also like to overlay a dog nose filter, some nice tutorials for facial keypoints detection exist [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection/details/deep-learning-tutorial).

#### (4) Add Functionality for Dog Mutts

Currently, if a dog appears 51% German Shephard and 49% poodle, only the German Shephard breed is returned.  The algorithm is currently guaranteed to fail for every mixed breed dog.  Of course, if a dog is predicted as 99.5% Labrador, it is still worthwhile to round this to 100% and return a single breed; so, you will have to find a nice balance.  

#### (5) Experiment with Multiple Dog/Human Detectors

Perform a systematic evaluation of various methods for detecting humans and dogs in images.  Provide improved methodology for the `face_detector` and `dog_detector` functions.
